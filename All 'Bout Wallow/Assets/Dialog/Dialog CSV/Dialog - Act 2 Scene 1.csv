SS,"Hey, clown!"
W,"Yo, Sharpie! You catch that fight?"
SS,Bah! You get lucky.
W,Is that so?
SS,Yes. Fire Breater was slow and stupid. He should have retired years ago.
W,"Well, he's retired now."
SS,Grr.... hey! What's that?
W,This? This is hothead's old fire rod.
SS,"Well, give it here!"
W,"Why? He won't be needing it. Besides, I won the match. I deserve some compensation."
SS,I should kill you for this... but I won't.
W,And why's that?
SS,Because Lion Tamer requests you for HIS act. He has dibs.
W,Fine by me. One down two to go!
SS,"Hah! You really can make good jokes! See you later, fool!"
