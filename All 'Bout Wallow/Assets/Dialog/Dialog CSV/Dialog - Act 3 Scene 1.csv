W,"Oh hey man, how you doing?"
SS,Guess
W,"Well, you look kinda mad. Also confused. And maybe... gassy?"
SS,You're darn right I am!
W,Well that's no problem. Just try not to swallow as much air when you eat.
SS,"NOT GASSY! ANGRY! You beat up two of best performers, and now you have whip!"
W,"Oh yeah. This is my new problem solver. When I come across I problem, I can whip it good."
SS,I AM YOUR PROBLEM! I am tired of your smug face. Next round you will fight me!
W,"Wait, well if you're tired of my face, wouldn't that mean you don't want me to help with your act?"
SS,"When I am done with act, you will have no face!"
W,"Okay, but you would still have to see it during the fight, right?"
SS,BAAH! Get out of my way!
W,"Wow, rude."
