W,"Hey, Smokey."
FB,Aha! So you finally arrive! I was worried you'd have run to the next town.
W,Wouldn't miss going against you for the world.
FB,I wouldn't miss you either. My aim is too good to miss you.
W,"Go on ahead and laugh, while you still have lungs."
FB,Heheheeheh! How do you plan to beat me? You don't even have a weapon!
W,"Yes, I do."
FB,!?! ...where?
W,I found a sword in the garbage. The Sword Swallow must've chucked it out.
FB,Well... I....
W,What?
FB,"N-n-nothing. Saay, how about, uh, a snack?"
W,Snack?
FB,Did I stutter?
W,Yes.
FB,Never mind the details! This cake... it's to die for!
