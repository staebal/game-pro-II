//Here is how the sword swallower damages Wallow

//In boss code:
void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D other){
	if (other.gameObject.tag == "Player" && caninjure) {
		other.gameObject.SendMessage("ApplyDamage", 1);
	}
}



//In Wallow's code:
void ApplyDamage(int damageamount) {
	health -= damageamount;
}





//Here is an example on how a fireball would damage a boss


//In fireball code:
void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D other){
	//Damage object if enemy
	if (other.gameObject.tag == "Enemy") {
		other.gameObject.SendMessage("ApplyDamage", 1);
	}
	//The fireball will die since it collided with something
	Destroy (gameObject);
}

//In the boss code:
void ApplyDamage(int damageamount) {
	if(canbehurt){
		health -= damageamount;
	}
}
