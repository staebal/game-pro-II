Chef Tony: Hoy!
???: Hello...*Chef Tony*...
Chef Tony: Exactly how many Miracle Blade™ knives would you like to buy??
Chef Tony: (Finally, a sale!)
???: Zero.
???: However--
Chef Tony: Now listen here, just think of the money you could save!
Chef Tony: You could be cutting concrete with these fine pieces of cutlery!
???: How would that save money, exactly?
Chef Tony: How could it *not* save money?
???: ...
???: In any case, I know of someone who may be more interested in your so-called knives.
???: Might you be familiar with someone named...
???: ...James?
Chef Tony: James!?!?
Chef Tony: The greatest gasmaster that ever lived?
Chef Tony: The single best customer of Miracle Blades™??
Chef Tony: But James died ten years ago!
Chef Tony: Everyone knows that!
???: Perhaps so.
???: However, if you wish to learn the *true* fate of the one called James...
???: I would advise you to *seek the shoes*.
Chef Tony: So...are you saying that you *don't* want to buy Miracle Blades™?
Chef Tony: They come with a lifetime guarantee, and if you select expedited shipping--
???: Remember...seek the shoes!
Chef Tony: I don’t need to take orders from you!
Chef Tony: Unless those orders are for Miracle Blades™!
