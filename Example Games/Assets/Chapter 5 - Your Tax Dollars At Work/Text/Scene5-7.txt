Announcement: WARNING!
Announcement: EMERGENCY CONTAINMENT SYSTEM OVERRIDE SEQUENCE ACTIVATED!
Announcement: AS PART OF SAFETY PROTOCOL GAMMA...
Announcement: ...ALL PERSONNEL MUST WEAR GAS MASKS!
***
Like Mike: Three gas masks!  Perfect, that's one more than we need!
***
Chief Scientist: You fools!  You’ve doomed us all!
Chief Scientist: This machine was designed to contain James by locking him in a separate dimension!
Chief Scientist: In the years since his imprisonment, the world has finally been free from his tyranny!
Chief Scientist: By deactivating it, the reaction with his gas will surely cause a chain reaction that will not only destroy this facility...
Chief Scientist: ...but will also disrupt the flow of time itself!
Chief Scientist: Anyway, I’m going to need this gas mask!
Chief Scientist: Plus another for my beloved guinea pig!

Like Mike: He took the gas masks and locked us in!
Like Mike: Now we have just one!
Chef Tony: No problem!

Chef Tony: I can use my Miracle Blade™ to slice and dice these pipes into a new gas mask!
Like Mike: But those pipes are attached to the concrete!  You'll never remove them in time!
Chef Tony: Don’t worry!  With its genuine German* stainless steel...
Chef Tony: ...my Miracle Blade™ All-Purpose Slicer™ can cut through concrete like a hot knife through butter!
***
Like Mike: That doesn’t look like it’s cutting at all...
Chef Tony: Of course it’s cutting!
Chef Tony: It has to be!
***
Like Mike: Take this gas mask!  It's the only way you'll survive!
***
Chef Tony: This can’t be happening!!!!!
Chef Tony: No...
*Chef Tony: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!11111
