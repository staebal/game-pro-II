Flying Basketball: Like Mike...
Flying Basketball: I--I have failed you.
Flying Basketball: I only wished to create a world ideal for honing your basketball abilities!
Like Mike: ....................
Flying Basketball: My time remaining is short!
Flying Basketball: Before...then...there is something that you must know.
Flying Basketball: As you know, your shoes once belonged to someone initialed "MJ".
Like Mike: Michael Jordan, of course! 
Flying Basketball: What you did not know....
Flying Basketball: .....is that I once went by that very name!
Chef Tony: But wait, that doesn't make sense!
Chef Tony: Michael Jordan's still alive in our timeline and definitely not a flying basketball?
Flying Basketball: Not yet!
Flying Basketball: But when my death drew near, many years in your future...
Flying Basketball: ...the scientists at the NBA's top-secret research facility allowed me to continue my existence in this form!
Flying Basketball: However, by that time, basketball had become a dying sport.
Flying Basketball: In order to train a true successor, I would have to travel through time itself!
Flying Basketball: I knew, however, that were was only enough power for a one-way trip.
Flying Basketball: I travelled across the world, searching for the one who I could train as my apprentice.
Flying Basketball: Then...at a orphanage with...questionable management...I finally found you!
Flying Basketball: Like Mike!
Flying Basketball: A name I bestowed upon you to overtly indicate the source of your greatness!
Flying Basketball: With my training, you were able to become the greatest basketball player that ever lived!
Like Mike: But why the evil plan? Your goal was already accomplished!
Flying Basketball: After your death, I found myself contemplating not only how to bring you back....
Flying Basketball: ...but how you could rise to even greater heights!
Flying Basketball: However...
Flying Basketball: I now realize that this plan was probably misguided, at best.
Flying Basketball: At last, I can be at peace.  It is.....over for me.
Flying Basketball: With the last of my power, I shall send you back to your own timeline...
Flying Basketball: Farewell...my friend.......
