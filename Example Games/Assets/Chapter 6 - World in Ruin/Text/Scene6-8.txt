Like Mike: I.....remember everything now!
Like Mike: But...Flying Basketball!  How could you do this??
Like Mike: I thought you were my friend!!!
Flying Basketball: Those two both betrayed you, each by leaving you to die!
Like Mike: No!  I sacrificed myself!
Like Mike: It is the basketball player’s sworn oath!
Like Mike: You, of all people, should know that, having ruled over the NBA with an iron fist!
Flying Basketball: Do you still not understand?
***
Flying Basketball: Shortly after your untimely demise...
Flying Basketball: I conducted an ancient ritual...one that I hoped would allow me to bring you back.
Flying Basketball: Instead, however, I revealed a Prophesy.
Flying Basketball: You, Chef Tony, know it well...
Flying Basketball: ...how only the CHOSEN CHEF, wielding the BLADE OF MIRACLES and SOLES OF AIR, could resurrect Like Mike.
Flying Basketball: The SOLES OF AIR were, naturally, those magical shoes of yours, Like Mike.
Flying Basketball: However, the CHOSEN CHEF and BLADE OF MIRACLES eluded me for years.
Flying Basketball: I contacted the world's greatest celebrity chefs...
***
Paula Deen: Just add a stick of butta and it'll make everything better!
Flying Basketball: The butter just melted...
Paula Deen: I thought you just wanted to make him taste good, not resurrect him!
***
Emeril Lagasse: Let's kick this up a notch...BAM!
Flying Basketball: He's still dead.
Emeril Lagasse: That'll be $500,000.
***
Flying Basketball: All those efforts...wasted!
Flying Basketball: But then...there it was in the news!
Flying Basketball: "Fake Chef Illegally Peddling Low Quality 'Miracle' Knives...Report Sightings to Police"
Chef Tony: Fake? Low quality??? Now wait just a minute!
Flying Basketball: I knew this was the moment for which I had waited!
Flying Basketball: Given that you were a fugitive, however, I had no way to contact you.
Flying Basketball: Until, that is, I discovered that you slept near a payphone that somehow still worked!
Chef Tony: Of course I did! What if someone wanted to call me and order Miracle Blades??
Flying Basketball: .......................................
James: .......................................
Like Mike: .......................................
Flying Basketball: It was clear I had to act!
Flying Basketball: I called you and told you to fetch the Shoes that I had carefully positioned in your path!
Chef Tony: That...was you who called me on that payphone!????
Flying Basketball: Once you made contact with the shoes, they teleported you to the shrine...
Flying Basketball: ...and just as planned, Like Mike was at last resurrected!
James: But then, why did you bother to free me? How did I factor into this needlessly complicated plan?
Flying Basketball: The device in which you were imprisoned...only *it* possessed the necessary energy to tear the very fabric of spacetime!
Flying Basketball: By destroying it, I was able to use the resulting rift to transport both of us backward in time...
Flying Basketball: ...to the exact moment of the machine's activation!
Flying Basketball: In addition, the rift's power allowed me to at last unify us into the ultimate basketball entity!
Flying Basketball: With our combined basketball powers, we were able to achieve immortality...
Flying Basketball: ...and remake the entire world into a basketball utopia!
Flying Basketball: In this dimension, WE are the rulers!
Flying Basketball: No one can stand in our way!
Flying Basketball: Rejoin me, Like Mike, and together we shall rule this world!
Like Mike: I thought we were partners!
Like Mike: But I never saw you for what you truly were!
Like Mike: I'll never join you!
Like Mike: Guys?
Like Mike: It's time to end this!
James: I always knew that flying basketball was up to no good!
James: Chef Tony! Are you ready?
Chef Tony: I...I can't!
Chef Tony: My Miracle Blades™ failed once before!  I can't risk letting that happen again!
Like Mike: But Chef Tony! No knife can be used to cut through concrete!
James: You just made that up for your infomercial!
James: Surely, though, you'll be able to cut through this basketball of betrayal!
Chef Tony: ..................................
Chef Tony: Perhaps you're right. It's time......to slice our way to victory!!!!
Flying Basketball: You fools!
Flying Basketball: YOU'LL NEVER DEFEAT ME!!!!!!!!
